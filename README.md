Task: Card Identifier 


Create a well-designed application with five PictureBox controls. Each PictureBox should display a different card from the set of images shown below. 

When the user clicks any of the PictureBox controls, the name of the card should be displayed in a Label control. 

Include a label that holds your name at the bottom of the form and change the title bar of  the form to represent the name of your application.  
Change the Font properties of the labels to the font and size of your choice.

Follow good programming conventions for object names: include comments/remarks at the top of every method e.g. 
  // This method will display the 2 of diamonds when the image is clicked
